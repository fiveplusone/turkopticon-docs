* When a user or admin edits a review, a notice with timestamp should be added
  * It should not be possible to remove this notice
  * Notices should accumulate in a reasonable way if a review is edited multiple times
* When a user or admin edits a comment, a notice with timestamp should be added (not removable, should accumulate reasonably)
* Close github issues for above with comments pointing to appropriate commits
* Merge above changes into master
* Push these changes to live site on turkopticon.ucsd.edu
* Change "development schedule" on docs.turkopticon.info/devel to "in progress"

Completed: all.

Goals for Monday:

Not attempted:

* Set up SSL certificate (serve data to extension over HTTPS)
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Notes:

Yesterday a racist comment was posted to Turkopticon that was designed to bypass our profanity filter. I removed the comment manually. But this is a new kind of abuse that makes two projects more urgent:

* Let administrators edit reviews and comments through the user interface
* Update the moderation system

The second will involve talking to users at length. It will happen in the future. The first can be done quickly. To do it, I set up the development sandbox on devel.turkopticon.info and created a development workflow using git branches.

Goals for tomorrow:

* Document development workflow on this site
* Let administrators edit comments
* Let users edit own comments
* When a user or admin edits a review, a notice with timestamp should be added
  * It should not be possible to remove this notice
  * Notices should accumulate in a reasonable way if a review is edited multiple times
* When a user or admin edits a comment, a notice with timestamp should be added (not removable, should accumulate reasonably)
* Close github issues for above with comments pointing to appropriate commits
* Merge above changes into master
* Push these changes to live site on turkopticon.ucsd.edu
* Change "development schedule" on docs.turkopticon.info/devel to "in progress"
* Update docs.turkopticon.info to reflect change to docs.turkopticon.info/devel

Working project: Move Turkopticon to turkopticon.info/Linode

Initial goals for today:

* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar

Completed: None.

Failed:

* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar

Notes:

I tried systematically to connect to the UCSD VPN using the vpnc and anyconnect clients. Both failed, even with all firewall rules disabled. My guess is I am missing a setting, but I am going to stop trying. I uninstalled both VPN clients and undid the changes to the databases and MySQL configurations on both the UCSD server and quaoar. Instead of replicating the database, I will move the Rails application to quaoar and redirect calls to the API on the UCSD to the API on quaoar. This is the same pattern I used when we moved to UCSD, and it worked okay.

Schedule changes:

* Dropped "Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar"
* Moved "Move production Rails application to turkopticon.info" and associated tasks ahead of "Move PHP API"

Working project: Move Turkopticon to turkopticon.info/Linode

Initial goals for today:

* Make sure all PHP files are in place and most recent versions
* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar
* Make sure API log will not grow indefinitely
* Set up SSL
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Completed:

* Make sure all PHP files are in place and most recent versions
* Put PHP API under version control and on github ([here](https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-php-api))
* Make sure API log will not grow indefinitely
* Transfer ownership of Chrome extension to turkopticon.maint@gmail.com

Failed:

* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar

Not attempted:

* Set up SSL
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Notes:

I spent about five hours today trying to set up replication. I think MySQL and the databases are configured correctly. But I need to connect to the UCSD VPN to connect to the UCSD server. I have installed the UCSD VPN client (Cisco AnyConnect) but have not yet managed to connect to the VPN. Currently I get an "unable to contact" error. I think I need to open ports in the firewall to connect to the VPN. I have tried a few things but will try more systematically tomorrow.

Schedule changes:

* All tasks up to Mon Feb 24 have been pushed back one working day
