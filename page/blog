Working project: Update documentation site, communicate with users

Initial goals for today:

* Buy SSL certificate
* Set up SSL certificate (serve data to extension over HTTPS)
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS (don't post yet; it won't work, as the DB will not be up to date)

Completed: None.

Attempted: None.

Notes:

1. Sunday Feb 23 Lilly and I met and talked about Turkopticon at length. We prioritized all the tasks on the [known issues list](http://docs.turkopticon.info/devel#issues). Monday and Tuesday I spent on non-Turkopticon tasks. My goals for today are below.

2. Midori wrote to tell us that free SSL certificates can be had from [startssl.com](http://www.startssl.com).

Revised goals for today:

* Put docs.turkopticon.info on github
* Update development page on this site based on notes from meeting with Lilly
* Make an [issue](https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-rails-app/issues) for each task
* Post to turkopticon-discuss:
  * Now open source
  * Current priorities
  * Work plan
      * Schedule, not deadlines
      * When an email arrives that has a task associated with it, bump that task
  * Big open questions
      * Moderation in the short and medium-term
          * Short term: add more moderators. Process?
          * Adding more moderators does not solve the problem of moderating comments, which can't be flagged, but Lilly has volunteered to edit them manually if problem comments appear (and she can now do this because administrators can now edit comments through the site)
          * Long term: does Turkopticon need its own reputation system? Is there an elegant solution? We thought about letting people 'turn down' people whose reviews they don't trust. But this could be gamed on both ends: people who wanted to maliciously 'turn down' other users but actually trusted their reviews could simply not log in to the extension, or use multiple accounts, and if someone was 'turned down', they could make a new account and keep trolling.
      * Review form
          * Let reviewers create their own fields?

Completed:

* Put docs.turkopticon.info on github
* Update development page on this site based on notes from meeting with Lilly

Not completed:

* Make an issue for each task
* Post to turkopticon-discuss

Goals for tomorrow:

* Let users edit own reviews and comments
* Let administrators edit reviews and comments through user interface

Initial goals for today:

* Buy SSL certificate
* Set up SSL certificate (serve data to extension over HTTPS)
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Completed:

* Create development sandbox at devel.turkopticon.info
* Create development workflow
* Put devel.turkopticon.info under version control
* Start using github issue tracker (<a href="https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-rails-app/issues/">here</a>)

Not attempted:

* Buy SSL certificate
* Set up SSL certificate (serve data to extension over HTTPS)
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Notes:

Yesterday a racist comment was posted to Turkopticon that was designed to bypass our profanity filter. I removed the comment manually. But this is a new kind of abuse that makes two projects more urgent:

* Let administrators edit reviews and comments through the user interface
* Update the moderation system

The second will involve talking to users at length. It will happen in the future. The first can be done quickly. To do it, I set up the development sandbox on devel.turkopticon.info and created a development workflow using git branches.

Goals for tomorrow:

* Document development workflow on this site
* Let administrators edit comments
* Let users edit own comments
* When a user or admin edits a review, a notice with timestamp should be added
  * It should not be possible to remove this notice
  * Notices should accumulate in a reasonable way if a review is edited multiple times
* When a user or admin edits a comment, a notice with timestamp should be added (not removable, should accumulate reasonably)
* Close github issues for above with comments pointing to appropriate commits
* Merge above changes into master
* Push these changes to live site on turkopticon.ucsd.edu
* Change "development schedule" on docs.turkopticon.info/devel to "in progress"
* Update docs.turkopticon.info to reflect change to docs.turkopticon.info/devel

Working project: Move Turkopticon to turkopticon.info/Linode

Initial goals for today:

* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar

Completed: None.

Failed:

* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar

Notes:

I tried systematically to connect to the UCSD VPN using the vpnc and anyconnect clients. Both failed, even with all firewall rules disabled. My guess is I am missing a setting, but I am going to stop trying. I uninstalled both VPN clients and undid the changes to the databases and MySQL configurations on both the UCSD server and quaoar. Instead of replicating the database, I will move the Rails application to quaoar and redirect calls to the API on the UCSD to the API on quaoar. This is the same pattern I used when we moved to UCSD, and it worked okay.

Schedule changes:

* Dropped "Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar"
* Moved "Move production Rails application to turkopticon.info" and associated tasks ahead of "Move PHP API"

## <a name="2014.02.13"></a> Thu Feb 13 2014

Working project: Move Turkopticon to turkopticon.info/Linode

Initial goals for today:

* Make sure all PHP files are in place and most recent versions
* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar
* Make sure API log will not grow indefinitely
* Set up SSL
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Completed:

* Make sure all PHP files are in place and most recent versions
* Put PHP API under version control and on github ([here](https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-php-api))
* Make sure API log will not grow indefinitely
* Transfer ownership of Chrome extension to turkopticon.maint@gmail.com

Failed:

* Replicate UCSD production database on quaoar

Not attempted:

* Set up SSL
* Make new version of user.js that calls api.turkopticon.info over HTTPS
* Post new user.js to turkopticon-discuss with install info

Notes:

I spent about five hours today trying to set up replication. I think MySQL and the databases are configured correctly. But I need to connect to the UCSD VPN to connect to the UCSD server. I have installed the UCSD VPN client (Cisco AnyConnect) but have not yet managed to connect to the VPN. Currently I get an "unable to contact" error. I think I need to open ports in the firewall to connect to the VPN. I have tried a few things but will try more systematically tomorrow.

Schedule changes:

* All tasks up to Mon Feb 24 have been pushed back one working day
