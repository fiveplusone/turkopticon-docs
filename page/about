# About Turkopticon

## <a name="what"></a> What

[Turkopticon](http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu) is a web application and browser add-on for reviewing employers (“requesters”) on [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://mturk.com).

## <a name="why"></a> Why

Turkopticon exists to help Mechanical Turk workers share information about good and bad tasks and employers.

Its initial design was motivated by the [responses to our 2008 Workers' Bill of Rights survey](http://turkwork.differenceengines.com/blog/).
