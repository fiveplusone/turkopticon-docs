## <a name="issues"></a> Known issues

### Unprioritized, big questions

* Useless reviews; "at-a-glance" rating no longer trustworthy
* Does moderation need to be redesigned?
* Old reviews should not count the same as new reviews
* Reviewing HITs, not just requesters

### Unprioritized, medium-sized questions

* Moderator queue grows indefinitely; should be silent 'ignore flag' action
* Flagging or otherwise moderating comments

### Highest priority

* Some users don't get verification emails

### High priority

* People often accidentally set display name to default ("s...@g...")
* Can't change attribute score to "N/A"
* Requesters sometimes change names on AMT, causing general confusion

### Medium priority

* Search is buggy
* Would like to get email when new review for a requester is posted
* Would like to get email when review flagged or commented
* Would like to save draft review
* Policies are unclear; policy documents inconsistent and disorganized
* Can't delete account
* Since server move to UCSD, angry requesters complain to UCSD

### Low priority

* Would like to be able to see review after posting, not be sent back to mturk
* Requester list page is slow
* Firefox extension only passes "preliminary review"

## <a name="questions"></a> Open questions

* What should we do about useless reviews? Do we need to redesign moderation? (The second question connects to civility policy too.)
* Is it urgent to flag or otherwise moderate comments? Lilly has volunteered to edit problem comments manually if people email us about them. Is that enough for now?
* What review fields should we add to the review form? Should we let reviewers add their own fields? If so, how should these show up in the extension? Should we do this in stages (for example: add some official new fields, then let people add their own fields later)?
* Should old reviews count less than new reviews? How do we decide the threshold? Should users be able to decide this on their own? If so, what should the default be?
* Is it important to be able to review specific HITs, not just requesters?
* Should we have "profile" pages for requesters? If so, what should go on them? Should requesters be allowed to "claim" these pages somehow (if this is even possible)?
* For moderators:
  * Is it a problem that the list of flagged reviews grows forever? Do we need a silent 'ignore flag' option that makes a flagged review disappear from the list of flagged reviews?
  * Do we need more moderators? How should we pick them?

## <a name="workflow"></a> Development workflow

This workflow can be used to develop new features in the <a href="https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-rails-app">Turkopticon Rails app</a>. These instructions assume the user has ssh access to quaoar, the machine that hosts turkopticon.info.

For information on branching in git, read <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching">Chapter 3, "Git branching", of <em>Pro Git</em> by Scott Chacon</a>. For information on git, read <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics">Chapter 2, "Git basics"</a>.

1. Log in to quaoar.
2. <code>cd /home/turkopticon/public/devel.turkopticon.info/turkopticon</code>
3. <code>git branch issueXX</code>, where <code>XX</code> is the number of the <a href="https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-rails-app/issue">issue</a> the feature aims to address. If there is no issue, either make one or name the branch something descriptive (e.g., <code>let-admins-edit-comments</code>).
4. <code>git checkout issueXX</code>
5. Make and commit changes.
6. To test, restart the app while this branch is checked out (<code>touch tmp/restart.txt</code>).
7. Once complete and tested, merge the branch into <code>devel</code>:
<blockquote>
  <code>git checkout devel</code><br/>
  <code>git merge issueXX</code>
</blockquote>
8. Restart the app again to make sure the merge worked and didn't break anything (<code>touch tmp/restart.txt</code>).
9. Delete the feature branch:
<blockquote>
  <code>git branch -d issueXX</code>
</blockquote>
10. Push to the github repository:
<blockquote>
  <code>git push origin devel</code>
</blockquote>

The changes can be merged into <code>master</code> through the github interface or in a local repository (and then pushed to the github repository). After merging changes, restart the application to make them live.
